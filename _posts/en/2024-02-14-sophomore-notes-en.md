This semester I moved to Zhuhai. Overall, the population density isn’t as high as in Guangzhou, so it feels relatively quieter, and the roads are wider too. But since there’s no subway, traveling farther away is less convenient. As for food, there aren’t as many chain restaurants as in Guangzhou—most are individually run shops. The vibe overall feels somewhat similar to Chenggong.

### Classes

As for coursework, my major classes felt rather scattered. My motivation to study them wasn’t all that clear, so I more or less approached it as general background knowledge, without really putting my full energy into it. One elective I wanted to take didn’t open because too few people signed up, and other courses clashed with my schedule. For my minor, I could only take *Foundations of Mathematical Logic* due to time conflicts, but the professor taught quite slowly. Altogether, this made the semester feel much more relaxed compared to before, giving me time to explore some things I was genuinely interested in[^1].

[^1]: Of course, this kind of leisure always comes with a price later on… 〒▽〒

Among the courses I took, Professor Xiao’s *Introduction to Analytic Philosophy* was especially thought-provoking. I actually stumbled into this course by accident. Initially, I signed up thinking I’d learn about Wittgenstein, Frege, and so on, but it turned out to be completely different—more like an intensive English course. Every week, we had to read short pieces of philosophy in English, and later on, even full journal articles[^2]. But gradually working through these texts did improve my English reading skills. Even though it wasn’t the content I had expected, I still gained some unexpected insights.

[^2]: Totally my fault for not checking the syllabus carefully when choosing courses 〒▽〒

Some key takeaways:

- **Principle of charity**: To avoid misunderstanding others, when someone’s view looks obviously wrong, the first step is not to reject it outright, but to ask whether you’ve fully understood their meaning, and whether their position might be reasonable under certain conditions.

- **Personal identity**: Up until now, I’d thought about consciousness mainly from the perspective of neuroscience. I hadn’t realized there’s also this concept of personal identity. The short essay *A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality* was excellent—relatively accessible in language, yet dealing with fascinating philosophical questions.

- **Punctuation**: I hadn’t expected English writing to require such careful attention to punctuation. I’d always just used it randomly before ≡(▔﹏▔)≡

- And I got to experience teaching methods and philosophies quite different from most classes I’d taken before.

### On the “Right to Skip Class”

I want to take this chance to briefly discuss whether students have the right to skip class.  

Almost everyone has thought at some point: *This class session might be less valuable for me than doing something else with the time.* But in my experience, skipping class is often seen in formal contexts as a bad habit. Here we seem to find a tension between what social norms prescribe and what personal development might actually require[^3]. That tension raises the question of whether students have the right to skip class.

First, notice that the value of attending class versus doing something else is a subjective judgment. Before actually doing it, we can’t know the true value of an action[^4]—not to mention the butterfly effects it might set off. So if our guiding principle is a student’s personal development, it’s difficult to reach consensus on what choice is “absolutely correct.” This means that the decision-maker bears a direct relationship to the consequences of the choice. If you think the one who directly causes an outcome should bear responsibility for it, then the decision-maker should take responsibility for whether to skip class. From this follows: whoever bears the *main responsibility* for a student’s personal development should also hold the right to decide whether that student can skip class[^5].

Thus, whether students have the right to skip class depends on whether they themselves bear the main responsibility for their own development.



>Apart from the issues I noted in the footnotes, my argument also has a gap around the definition of “responsibility.” I tried defining it as the cost to an agent arising from the difference between actual and expected outcomes of a decision. But this raises further questions, like how to compare different costs (since I relied on the concept of “main responsibility”). I can’t think this through clearly for now ≡(▔﹏▔)≡

[^3]: In this discussion, I assume that the social norm of “treating skipping class as a vice” is aimed at promoting individual development. My concern is under what conditions a student has the right to choose, not whether skipping class itself is right or wrong.  
[^4]: Excluding cases where someone could predict the future with complete accuracy. But even then, it’s hard to judge which choice is better (like comparing two vectors without a clear rule for size). Without a precise, consensus-based evaluation standard, it’s still impossible to reach agreement on an absolutely correct choice.  
[^5]: Here, “main responsibility” means something like 80%—clearly much greater than other parties. I rely on the near equivalence between “bearing main responsibility” and “bearing total responsibility” to extend a conclusion that originally applied only to the latter case. If you reject that near equivalence, then my argument applies only to cases of total responsibility.

### Philosophy Lectures

I also sat in on a few philosophy lectures this semester. Unfortunately, I missed several I was most interested in because of time conflicts 〒▽〒. The ones I did attend included:

- **Exploring the Boundaries of Decidability**: Since I haven’t studied modal logic and it was in English, I couldn’t follow much.  
- **Introduction to Structured Proof Theory**: Felt more like a light overview; didn’t get much out of it, but it pointed me toward things worth exploring further, like sequent calculus and the axiom of choice.  
- **That’s Just How It Is—On Comparisons Between Fiction and Reality**: About how truths about the world can be drawn from fiction. The idea that “the false can contain truth” felt fascinating. I plan to read some David Lewis, since he kept coming up—this talk, and the next one too.  
- **A Philosophical Analysis of Temporality and Backward Causation**: Surprising to see people still working on this topic today. I only grasped the parts I was already somewhat familiar with, and didn’t fully understand the arguments. Unexpectedly, Heidegger and phenomenology also showed up here.

### A Few Weird Ideas

1. Since logically we can’t prove the correctness of scientific theories, could we instead use machine learning to *enumerate all scientific theories consistent with current experience*, and then narrow down as new evidence comes in?

   The *Universal Approximation Theorem* in deep neural networks suggests this might be feasible. But that theorem only says networks can approximate continuous functions—what about discontinuous ones? This could affect whether we can search the entire theory space. Possible ways forward: prove approximation holds for discontinuous functions; argue they aren’t crucial for fitting experience; show discontinuous functions can themselves be approximated by continuous ones; or look for alternative ML methods.

   
   
   >***Universal approximation theorem***: For any continuous function on a compact subset of $$\mathbb{R}^{D_i}$$, there exists a neural network that can approximate it to arbitrary accuracy.

2. While Hume’s problem of induction denies that we can *prove* scientific theories to be true, that doesn’t mean we can’t ever have a correct theory. So: can our theories predict the future with precision?  

   Thinking about this made me wonder if *precise prediction* conflicts with *free will*. When I asked GPT if there’s philosophical work on this, it pointed me to Nelson Goodman’s *Fact, Fiction, and Forecast*, which itself builds on Lewis’s *Counterfactuals*. And there he was again (⊙ˍ⊙).

3. Maybe philosophy of language could help us understand GPT better? Like how “the limits of language mean the limits of the world”—could this offer new insights into GPT?

4. In AI philosophy, Professor Wang Huaping in the philosophy department seems to be working on related topics. He offered a general elective this semester called *Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence*, but hardly anyone signed up, so it probably won’t run ≡(▔﹏▔)≡

### Games

This semester I:

- Finally finished *Hollow Knight* (after playing for more than a year)  
- Also played *Elden Ring*  
- Tried *A Dance of Fire and Ice*, cleared the first six levels—super unforgiving 〒▽〒  
- Played *Undertale* at the start of the break, completing both Neutral and Pacifist routes. Really impressive game—probably my first meta-game. It makes brilliant use of the medium. At one point it crashed suddenly, and I thought my computer was broken. The setup of the Genocide route is fascinating too—it feels like a game that *shouldn’t* be played, which gives it a kind of paradoxical charm.

That’s all for now.
