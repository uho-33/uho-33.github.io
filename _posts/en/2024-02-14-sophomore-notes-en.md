This semester I moved to Zhuhai. The overall feeling is that the population density is not as high as in Guangzhou, it's relatively quieter, and the roads are also wider than those in Guangzhou. For transportation, since there's no subway, it's not very convenient to go to relatively distant places. As for food, there aren't as many brand stores nearby as in Guangzhou; mostly they are independently operated shops. The overall feeling is somewhat similar to Chenggong.

In terms of classes, I feel that the content of the major courses is quite miscellaneous, and the motivation for learning is not very clear, so overall I treat it as something of a popular science nature, being relatively casual; the specialized electives didn't have enough people interested so they weren't offered, and other time slots weren't suitable; for the minor, due to time conflicts, I could only choose "Foundations of Mathematical Logic," but the teacher taught quite slowly. These factors combined made this semester relatively more relaxed compared to previous ones, giving me the opportunity to do some things I was interested in[^1].

[^1]: But this leisure comes at a price later, sigh 〒▽〒

Among the courses I took this semester, I feel that Teacher Xiao's "Introduction to Analytic Philosophy" was quite inspiring. I stumbled into this course by accident, originally choosing it with the idea of learning about Wittgenstein, Frege, etc. The content turned out to be completely different from what I expected, becoming an intensive English course where we had to read English philosophical essays every week, and later covered several philosophical journal papers[^2]. However, gradually working through English materials like this, I feel that my English reading ability has indeed improved. Although it didn't cover the content I naively expected at the beginning, there were other unexpected gains.

[^2]: It's my fault for not carefully reading the syllabus when choosing courses 〒▽▔

- **Principle of charity**: To avoid misunderstanding others' viewpoints, when you feel there are obvious errors in the other person's views, the first thing to do is not to deny the other person, but to think about whether you fully understand what the other person means, and whether the other person's viewpoint is reasonable in some situations.

- **Personal identity (人格同一性)**: Regarding the issue of consciousness, I previously focused mainly on neuroscience aspects, and indeed didn't think that there was such a thing that was also related. *A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality* is quite good, with relatively accessible language and interesting philosophical content.

- **Punctuation**: I didn't expect that there were so many things to pay attention to regarding punctuation in English writing. I used to use punctuation randomly when writing essays ≡(▔﹏▔)≡

- I also experienced some teaching methods and concepts that were different from most of the courses I had experienced before
