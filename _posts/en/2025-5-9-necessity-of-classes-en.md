## Are Classes Necessary?

A fairly widespread view holds: *“Classes exist for learning knowledge.”*  
But if our goal really is knowledge acquisition, we may find that going to class isn’t necessarily the most reasonable choice—sometimes skipping class seems more rational.  

We need to recognize that classes are not the only way to learn. Besides formal avenues like books, blogs, or videos, even activities traditionally dismissed as “mere entertainment” can serve as learning. Take watching anime as an example:

> For popular older shows, you can easily find resources on streaming platforms like Bilibili. But if you want to follow a brand-new show, domestic “review-before-release” policies usually cause a three-episode delay. To watch right away, you need to actively search for resources—unintentionally training your online search skills.

> In this process, you might come across Taiwan’s Bahamut Anime website. To use it, you’ll need to wrestle with VPN technology, and along the way pick up some knowledge of network architecture.  
>
> For more niche new shows, mainstream platforms often won’t have them. Then you’ll turn to resources like [Nyaa](https://nyaa.land/), which uses magnet links—bringing you into contact with P2P networking.  
>
> And if you want to enhance your viewing and audio experience, you might start tinkering with software like PotPlayer and LAV filters, and in the process learn about audio/video codecs, subtitle rendering, and GPU performance.  

Yet in today’s education system, there seems to be a common belief that knowledge can *only* be gained through classes. As a result, students’ schedules are packed full with courses.  

So, are classes really the most efficient way to learn?  

My thought is: not necessarily. Classes at least suffer from the following drawbacks:

- **Lack of control over pacing**:  
  - Unlike books or online courses, students in class can’t pause to think or revisit points at will—they must follow the teacher’s pace. Once something passes, it’s gone. [^1]  
  - Knowledge is often interconnected like a web. Without control over pacing, students can’t freely jump to related material, making it harder to integrate new knowledge with what they already know. This often leads to a scattered, fragmented sense of learning.  
  - Each student has their own “best learning hours,” but class schedules don’t allow for flexible alignment with individual rhythms.  
- **Weak targeting**: Different students have different backgrounds. Faced with large gaps, a teacher often teaches to the “middle level.” For advanced students, this wastes time on what they already know; for beginners, the lack of prerequisite knowledge creates heavy cognitive load, sometimes leading to complete breakdowns, requiring them to relearn everything afterward.  
- **High demands on teachers**: We can’t guarantee that every assigned teacher is the right fit for every student, nor can we guarantee that all teachers have the ability to clearly explain a course.  

In short, classes may not be the best way to learn knowledge. In terms of pacing, they fall short of books and online courses; in terms of personalized targeting, they lag behind large language models (see YJango’s [渐构 Project](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1MPoeYtEdw/) for a fun example).  

If “classes exist for knowledge acquisition” doesn’t hold up, then from a student’s perspective, what other reasons might justify going to class? Here are some possibilities I see right now:

- **Inspiration**: Every individual is unique, with different life experiences. It’s reasonable to expect others may hold insights outside our own cognition. In class, we might encounter content that clashes with our assumptions, sparking deeper thought. [^2]  
- **As an introduction**: When we want to explore a field but don’t know where to start—or are simply lazy—classes can provide a structured overview.  
- **As a credentialing tool**: If attendance scores are what matter, then so be it.  
- **As a social activity**: Classrooms provide a shared context across backgrounds, enabling us to form new connections, get to know people, and stay informed within a circle.  
- **Learning community paradigms**: Science isn’t an activity detached from people—it’s governed by the paradigms of its community, full of tacit rules: which kinds of challenges are legitimate [^3], which assumptions are acceptable, what counts as important research. By observing and imitating the teacher, who is part of that community, we can learn its implicit knowledge. [^4]  
- **As an experience**: If we agree with Camus in *The Myth of Sisyphus* that for the absurd person “what matters is not the best life (quality), but the most life (quantity),” then class can be justified simply as one more experience.

## What Should We Learn?

The above discussion assumes we already know *what* we want to learn, and concludes that classes may not be the most reasonable option. In reality, however, another question arises: *What should we learn?*  

This question reduces to: *Why do we learn?* Because what we should learn depends on the goals we want to achieve through learning. Without a goal, we can’t answer. And we need to recognize: there are no absolutely “right” goals (God is dead). Goals are non-rational; reason cannot give them unquestionable justification.  

In the typical (Chinese?) university model, each student is placed into a major, and the curriculum plan prescribes what they should learn. Personally, I find this problematic:

- From the perspective of understanding the world: the world exists as an unknown whole, while disciplines are human-made divisions. There’s no guarantee that pre-divided majors and training programs actually help students understand the world, rather than binding their hands.  
- One possible counterargument is that the curriculum is designed to train students for traditional science. But not every student’s purpose in entering a major is to someday join the game of traditional science. In today’s society, diplomas function as important signals [^5], often serving as the basis for evaluating a person’s worth. To more easily reach their goals, students are forced into university and into specific majors.  
- Suppose we *do* want to enter the game of traditional science—does that mean we must strictly follow the prescribed curriculum? I don’t think so. Everyone has different potential, and a fixed plan can’t fit all. Moreover, the paradigm of traditional science is not immutable: what seems essential today may change tomorrow, while curricular updates always lag behind.  
- Some argue that universities do this to create an efficient division of labor, producing large numbers of “specialists” to build society. But we can question this from multiple angles:  
  - Does society really need this many “specialists”? If so, why are so many people unemployed? And of those employed, how many actually use the knowledge from their major?  
  - With the development of AI, more and more jobs will be automated. This should liberate people from work, yet widespread anxiety about “being replaced” persists. In my observation, this anxiety stems mainly from two sources:  
    - The belief that *without work, one cannot survive*: Without jobs, we can’t secure a comfortable life. But as technology reduces required labor, people must enter endless rat races or gray markets just to make a living.  
    - Work as a source of self-worth: We live in a “God is dead” world with no absolute value system. Everything is open to doubt. Some people anchor their life’s meaning in their work (“only I can do this job”). When AI replaces such jobs, it destroys that meaning. The collapse of life’s meaning can lead to despair, and phenomena such as addiction to virtual worlds, substance abuse, or or becoming a 地雷女（‘landmine girl’) are all responses to this. If we hope people can remain “normal,” education needs to play a key role—whether by guiding them toward self-realization (Nietzsche’s Übermensch) or by teaching them not to question some external value system (a kind of “doublethink,” selectively using reason).  
  - What society truly needs is not massive quantities of specialists, but *high-quality talent*. Current education tries to increase the absolute number of talented individuals by scaling up the base population. Many are discarded by the system because they don’t fit, yet society shows them little care—instead branding them “failures,” dismissing their potential, and leaving them to struggle with mental illness.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Some might argue: “But you can raise your hand and ask questions in class.” The problem is, teachers must complete their teaching tasks and can’t instantly address every confusion. On the other hand, students themselves often can’t immediately articulate what exactly they don’t understand—it’s more like a sudden blankness. Clarifying the question takes time, and meanwhile the class moves on, adding new load, which may later cause a “snowball collapse.” If they stop to clarify, they may miss new content and create further problems.  
[^2]: But it’s a gamble. There’s no guarantee of inspiration; you might waste an entire semester with nothing gained.  
[^3]: For example, in a typical scientific context, we don’t question the correctness of Newton’s laws.
