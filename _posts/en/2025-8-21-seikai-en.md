## Preface

This piece is nothing more than a pile of scattered thoughts, not a fully structured essay. The paragraphs don’t necessarily connect tightly with one another.  

As the title suggests, I don’t claim to know any so-called “right answers.” My aim here is simply to bring back into view certain questions that may have been buried under “common sense.”  

**Note:** This post contains spoilers from the following works:  
- *School-Live!* (*Gakkō Gurashi!*) episodes 1–6  
- *Nichijou* (*My Ordinary Life*) episode 4  
- *Ave Mujica* episode 9  
- *Heavenly Delusion* (*Tengoku Daimakyo*) chapters 72–74  
- *Go Go Loser Ranger!* (*Sentai Daishikkaku*) chapter 158  

*(PS: The title borrows from the ending theme of *Go Go Loser Ranger!* — a work I personally find quite thought-provoking[^1], for the way it throws questions at the reader through cleverly constructed scenarios.)*

## Main Text

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

My preference for pure science partly comes from its clarity: it rests on a small set of clear rules, with new results always derivable from what has come before.  

Reality, however, is not like this. Suddenly, “I” am thrown into a world that runs on its own, indifferent to my being. I know nothing of it, nor of myself—and yet I am compelled to act. [^2]  

[^2]: An interesting connection: reinforcement learning studies precisely this kind of problem.  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

We arrive in this world for no clear reason, muddle through joys and sorrows, and then die — again without reason.  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

We don’t know whether life is a game we can restart again. Every choice may be unrepeatable; the path we can take might be only one. Any difference between two paths can become a reason for regret: you can regret losing A, regret obtaining A, or regret both losing and obtaining A.  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

*Does reality matter?*  

In *The Matrix*, no matter how painful “reality” is, it is portrayed as more “worth” pursuing than the pleasures of the virtual. In *School-Live!*, however, in a broken world, Yuki’s delusion of ordinary school life — born of her psychological collapse — becomes the very pillar that enables her clubmates to keep “living normally.”  

But if reality is so important, how can we rule out the possibility that what we call “reality” is just another layer of dream in *Inception*?

*“The so-called ordinary days we pass through may in fact be a series of miracles”*  

*Nichijou* (“My Ordinary Life”) bears the name of the everyday, yet it is stitched together from one absurd “non-everyday” after another. At first, its comedy hooks you, and you click through episodes almost without realizing it. But after watching several in a row, the strangeness itself becomes familiar; the extraordinary turns into routine. Most of the time it now feels “boring.” You keep clicking not because the fun continues, but because maybe — just maybe — the next episode won’t be boring.

【[从985到流浪汉，从顶尖人才到离经叛道，他却活成了所有人憧憬的样子 (From a 985 University Graduate to a Drifter — Once a Top Talent, Now Living the Life Everyone Envies)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1u2EqzHErn)】  
This video showcases a lifestyle that seems especially appealing today: stepping away from mainstream value systems, seizing the present, drifting from place to place. Yet paradoxically, freedom always seems to rest upon unfreedom. Social stability requires most people to obey rules; abundant goods and public infrastructure come from massive amounts of unfree labor.  

AI may free people from the second kind of unfreedom[^3], but the first seems destined to remain. (One perverse solution: uploading consciousness. *Heavenly Delusion* chapters 72–74 provide a vivid illustration.)  

[^3]: Unless, of course, “AI lives matter” too…  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

The pandemic reminded people again of the uncertainty of the future. Calls to “live in the moment” became popular once more — urging us to focus on present experience rather than anxiety over the uncertain future or unchangeable past.  

Taken to the extreme, this view would dismiss the pursuit of long-term benefits altogether. But that overlooks the fact that short-term benefits are limited in scope; some things can only be reached through long-term investment.  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

Out of distaste for endless competition (“内卷”), some go so far as to reject competition entirely, seeing it as an absolute evil. But that also means denying the genuine emotional impact of competitive works they themselves enjoy (such as *Uma Musume: Pretty Derby*).  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

We cannot choose our birth, yet we are forced to resent one another because of our identities.  

Almost all the time, we never really see the Other; what we see is only our imagined Other.

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

Hatred is partly rooted in an unchangeable past. Does that mean as long as one party remains, hatred can never truly disappear?  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

People often criticize labeling and misunderstanding others, urging us instead to see the “real” other person, to understand their true thoughts. But does that mean labeling and misunderstanding are absolute evils, to be avoided at all costs?  

Accurately conveying a viewpoint may take vast amounts of language (perhaps even infinite). Labels or misunderstandings can serve as a starting point for cognition — they compress vast information into a few words. Through step-by-step correction, we may actually reach others’ thoughts more efficiently.  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

People criticize “exam machines” (“做题家”), faulting their narrow values and cognitive modes, and call for more well-rounded development. Yet once freed from a single value system, we face a “godless” world with no absolute standards of value. We become *maigo* — lost children.  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

Why must we sacrifice for some grand ideal? Why must we live “authentically”? Why must we struggle against the absurd? Why can’t we escape the weight of freedom?  

(Perhaps) we did not choose to be here, but since we are, we are forced to bear the responsibility of freedom.  

Can we, then, accept others’ choice to flee?  

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

Today, with grand narratives distrusted and values diversified, the prevailing attitude seems to be: *“As long as it doesn’t affect others, how you live is none of my business.”* Taken to the extreme, this fosters social atomization.  

Yet paradoxically, some ideals seem to require infringing on others’ boundaries: controlling infectious diseases requires curbing freedoms; tackling climate change requires sacrifices from all nations; achieving communism would disrupt the lives of people within existing structures…

Finally, I’ll share an interesting comparative study I recently came across:
