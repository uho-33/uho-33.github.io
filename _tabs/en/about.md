Welcome~ ようこそ ( •̀ ω •́ )✧

This blog is a place to store my scattered writings. They aren’t confined to any single field: some may be passing whims, others the result of long reflection. But in either case, human time and energy are limited — I can’t promise these writings are fully polished, much less eternal. They simply record the thoughts I held at the moment I wrote them.  

As my experiences grow, my ideas may change at any time, even to the point of almost completely overturning earlier ones. Yet later ideas aren’t necessarily “better” than earlier ones. To keep past thoughts from being buried by time or drowned out by newer voices, I want to preserve them here, in the form of occasional blog posts.  

From this angle, the blog first and foremost serves myself — so readers may sometimes find obstacles when reading my texts. Still, I hope to share my thoughts with others, and I’ll do my best to reduce those barriers where I can. If you hold different views, I welcome your response: given the limits of my own experience, there will always be things I’ve overlooked.  

That’s all I’ve thought of for now. If you’d like to be notified of new posts as soon as they’re up, you’re welcome to subscribe via RSS or [email](https://mailchi.mp/225c2d7a0bf1/kohis-blog)[^1].
