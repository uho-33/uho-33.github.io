Welcome~ ようこそ~ ( •̀ ω •́ )✧

This is a place for my scattered thoughts and writings. They are not limited to any particular field - some might be just my momentary whims, others might be thoughts that have been brewing for a long time. But regardless of which type, human time and energy are always limited. I cannot guarantee that these words are absolutely perfect or even eternally unchanging. They only convey my thoughts at the time I wrote them.

As my personal experiences grow, my thoughts may change at any time, or I might even completely negate previous ideas. But later thoughts are not necessarily better than earlier ones. To prevent earlier thoughts from being buried by time and later voices, I want to record them through the form of blogging from time to time.

From this perspective, this blog primarily serves me, so readers may encounter some obstacles when reading my words. But I also hope to convey my thoughts to readers, and I will try to think of ways to reduce reading barriers when writing. If you have different views on what I write, please feel free to share them, because limited by personal experience, there may always be things I overlook.

That's all I can think of for now. If you want to get update notifications as soon as possible, welcome to subscribe to this blog via [RSS](https://uho-33.github.io/feed.xml) or [email subscription](https://mailchi.mp/225c2d7a0bf1/kohis-blog)[^1]~
