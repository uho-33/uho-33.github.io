# Feature Specification: Add English Mode with LLM Translation

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-english-mode`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add English mode with LLM-based translation and switchable provider"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A blog visitor wants to read the content in English to overcome language barriers. They toggle to English mode, which instantly switches to pre-translated English versions of all blog posts and interface elements, providing immediate access to content without waiting for real-time translation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor is viewing the blog in Chinese mode, **When** they click the English toggle, **Then** the interface switches to English and all visible content is translated to English
2. **Given** a visitor is in English mode, **When** they navigate to different posts, **Then** each post displays pre-translated English content, or falls back to real-time translation if no pre-translation exists
3. **Given** the repository owner, **When** they modify LLM provider configuration files, **Then** the next build uses the updated translation provider
4. **Given** the selected LLM provider is unavailable, **When** translation is requested, **Then** the system shows an error message and falls back to Chinese content

### Edge Cases
- What happens when LLM translation fails or times out?
- How does the system handle posts with mixed languages (preserving non-Chinese text)?
- What occurs when translation quota is exceeded?
- How are mathematical expressions and code blocks handled during translation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a language toggle button visible on all pages to switch between Chinese and English modes
- **FR-002**: System MUST pre-translate blog post content from Chinese to English using LLM during website build process
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide complete English localization including navigation, sidebar, footer, dates, and formatting during build process
- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple LLM translation providers (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, local models)
- **FR-005**: Repository owner MUST be able to configure and switch between different LLM providers through configuration files
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate static English pages during build time to eliminate runtime translation overhead
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve original formatting, links, and metadata in pre-translated content
- **FR-008**: Build process MUST handle translation failures gracefully by falling back to Chinese-only content with build warnings
- **FR-009**: Build process MUST respect LLM provider rate limits and implement retry mechanisms during translation phase
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to report translation quality issues
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain user's language preference across browser sessions
- **FR-012**: System MUST exclude code blocks, mathematical expressions, and proper nouns from translation to preserve technical accuracy
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide real-time translation fallback (e.g., Google Translate) for posts that lack pre-generated English versions
- **FR-014**: System MUST only retranslate content when source Chinese content has been modified, preserving existing translations otherwise
- **FR-015**: System MUST format dates, numbers, and other locale-specific elements according to English conventions when in English mode
- **FR-016**: System MUST only translate Chinese text content, preserving existing English, Japanese, or other non-Chinese languages as-is

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Translation**: Represents a translated version of content, includes source text, target text, provider used, timestamp, and quality indicators
- **LLM Provider Configuration**: Represents provider settings including API keys, endpoints, model parameters, and usage limits
- **User Language Preference**: Tracks visitor's chosen language mode and session information

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What is the acceptable translation response time for user experience? ‚Üí A: Translation done in advance during website build
- Q: How should the system handle new posts that haven't been translated yet? ‚Üí A: Attempt real-time translation by something like google translator
- Q: What level of admin authentication is required for LLM provider configuration? ‚Üí A: This is deployed in github pages, so the owner of this repo
- Q: How long should translated content be cached before retranslation? ‚Üí A: Permanent - only retranslate when source changes
- Q: What should be the scope of interface translation beyond post content? ‚Üí A: Complete localization including dates, formatting
- Q: Which languages should be translated during the translation process? ‚Üí A: Only translate Chinese, preserve other languages like English, Japanese
